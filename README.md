# Project Description
<p>This study is about providing a client-based program that implements loyalty schemes for their regular customers in our community in Batangas City. The manager of Sweetscape told us that the mobile app can be made at their branches in Libjo, Batangas City, San Pascual, Batangas, and P.Genato St. Lumang Palengke. This system is what we think is an easy way for customers to avoid standing in line because, with this system, they can schedule when they want to go to the salon. This software application assists salon and spa administrators in managing appointment scheduling, client information, and personnel schedules. The system has an easy-to-use interface that allows employees to simply schedule and monitor appointments while also allowing customers to make their own appointments online. Customers' main complaint with this service is the lengthy wait times for services owing to issues such as misunderstanding, poor connection, and inadequate slot management. In addition, the data of the consumers is saved offline, which makes the owner's evaluation of the stuff problematic. Overall, optimizing operations with resource usage analytics may assist salons in increasing productivity, cutting expenses, and giving customers better service. By leveraging data analytics, SweetScape can make informed decisions about how best to allocate resources and optimize their operations.</p>
