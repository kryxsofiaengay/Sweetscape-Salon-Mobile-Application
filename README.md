# Introduction

# Project Description
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the provision of real-time information on resource availability and use, computerized applications may assist businesses in more effectively allocating resources including staff, equipment, and materials. By ensuring that resources are used as effectively as possible, this can assist to save costs and boost efficiency. This study is about providing a client-based program that implements loyalty schemes for their regular customers in our community in Batangas City. The manager of Sweetscape told us that the mobile app can be made at their branches in Libjo, Batangas City, San Pascual, Batangas, and P.Genato St. Lumang Palengke. This system is what we think is an easy way for customers to avoid standing in line because, with this system, they can schedule when they want to go to the salon. This software application assists salon and spa administrators in managing appointment scheduling, client information, and personnel schedules. The system has an easy-to-use interface that allows employees to simply schedule and monitor appointments while also allowing customers to make their own appointments online. Customers' main complaint with this service is the lengthy wait times for services owing to issues such as misunderstanding, poor connection, and inadequate slot management. In addition, the data of the consumers is saved offline, which makes the owner's evaluation of the stuff problematic. Overall, optimizing operations with resource usage analytics may assist salons in increasing productivity, cutting expenses, and giving customers better service. By leveraging data analytics, SweetScape can make informed decisions about how best to allocate resources and optimize their operations.
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to adapt management tactics to changing trends is another key difficulty encountered by salon operators. Salon operators must modify their management tactics when new trends appear since the beauty industry is always evolving and growing. For a more inclusive approach to the success of beauty companies, keeping up with salon industry advancements is essential. The growth of organic and sustainable goods, the increasing demand for online booking, and home services are some of the major effects of salon business advances. The significant development in management is to find an experienced employee  and retain exceptional employees. As the business evolves, so does the need for elite people to be hired and retained in order to remain competitive. To do this, you must support continual education and training for your personnel while simultaneously cultivating a growth culture. Furthermore, a competitive compensation and benefits package is required to attract and retain great stylists and other salon employees.

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The agile development approach is a procedure through which a team manages an Agile software development project by segmenting its process parts into separate stages, with continual discussion and participation of market leaders to improve and iterate at each step of development. Customers describe the end-application of the goods and the specific challenges to be tackled as part of the Agile approach. After starting the work, teams develop a plan, execute the strategy, and then assess the results. It completely modifies the approach of delivering the final product to clients and meeting their expectations. (TechGropse, 2020). Following the defense, additional requirements or ideas from panelists are recognized and used, and subsequent iterations of the software are redesigned and built. Each iteration goes through all phases of the SDLC, and this process is repeated until the system is finished and downloaded.

### Defining Requirements
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defining requirements include compiling the group's opinions and proposals for which system to work with, as well as deciding on the best and most workable topic for their final project.

### Design
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a gathering of ideas, the proponents select a topic, and the project manager begins developing the tools, design, and algorithms that will be used to run the system.
# Development
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system design and documentation include the generation of HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL and algorithm files. These files will act as the mobile application. Additionally, the developers will design PHP algorithms to serve as the system backbone for connecting to the database. Thus, the final product will have a fully functional user interface for a Sweetscape platform. Documentation for the project will also begin at this phase when the system is under development.
    
### Testing
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A complete testing plan was conducted by the developers. For functional and non-functional measures were tested correctly to ensure that the developed system meets the goals. This also includes a phase of live testing to ensure that all links worked. Possible errors are debugged to release the system to the client.

### Deployment
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the testing phase, the system will be uploaded and administered online. This phase will includes the system’s debugging component, which ensures that the system operates properly on the app.
    
### Review
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While using customer feedback, it is vital that the product does include every feature requested by your customers.
